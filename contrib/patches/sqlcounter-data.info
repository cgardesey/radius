The following is a description of the sqlcounter-data.diff patch.
FreeRADIUS 1.x (and as to December 2008 even 2.x) doesn't support the data
sql counters without modification to the sqlcounter.c module so the only
support out of the box you get with FreeRADIUS is for timed-base sql counters
as you already familiar with (Max-All-Session and it's friends).

Venkatesh K <kaevee@gmail.com> has provided a patch to appply to the sqlcounter.c
code to provide data-based sqlcounters and even support to customize the check-item
value not to be octets but rather kilobytes or megabytes.

A sample configuration file for an sqlcounter also provided by Venkatesh is:

	sqlcounter noresetBytecounter {
	           counter-name = Total-Max-Octets
	           check-name = Max-Octets
	           reply-name = ChilliSpot-Max-Total-Octets
	           sqlmod-inst = sql
	           key = User-Name	
	           reset = never
	           counter-type = data
	           check-unit = KibiOctets
	           query = "SELECT
				(SUM(AcctInputOctets)+SUM(AcctOutputOctets))/1024 FROM radacct WHERE
				UserName='%{%k}'"
	}


It is crucial to remember that the maximum returned value from the counter is 4Gb because of the 32bit limit.
